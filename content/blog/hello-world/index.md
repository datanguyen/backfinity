Hi, I'm Dat Tan Nguyen - Enthusiast in building tools for human.

Currently, I work as a software engineer at [@upstarlabs](https://www.upstarlabs.com/) located in Ho Chi Minh City
, Vietnam. I work both on back-end and front-end by using my main weapons Java & JavaScript. I'm gradually jumping
 into DevOps culture.
 
 I love [clean code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), clean
  that solution and [clean architecture](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134494164/ref=emc_b_5_t), also passionate about
   writing code that my teammates love to read then maintain. Languages, libraries, and frameworks come and go, only
    techniques stay perpetually. Beside that, I spend time for my family and play table tennis, i'm really fall in
     love with this kind of sport. 
       
> I create this blog cause I want to share the lessons with you about software engineering that i've learn. Maybe some
> table tennis tricks and techniques if i have time :).

That's all for the first post, I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
Last but not least, you can find me more on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dattannguyencse).
