Hi, I'm Dat Tan Nguyen - Enthusiast in building tools for human.

Currently, I work as a senior engineer at [GroveHR](https://www.grovehr.com/), a new solution for the HR Industry.
I play a role in proposing technical solutions & architecture designs, reviewing codes & technical designs, implementations & operations. Responsibilities include making the GroveHR become a SaaS with characteristics: reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
 
 I love [clean code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [clean architecture](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134494164/ref=emc_b_5_t), also passionate about
   writing code that my teammates love to read then maintain. Languages, libraries, and frameworks come and go, only
    techniques stay perpetually. Beside that, I spend time for my family and play table tennis, i'm really fall in
     love with this kind of sport.

> table tennis tricks and techniques if i have time :).

That's all for the first post, I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
